## 💻🪛🧰 Laptop Repair & Performance Restoration

## Issue
- Laptop running very slow  
- Cooling fan making loud noise  
- System overheating  

## Diagnosis
Based on experience, the symptoms indicated a **hardware cooling issue** rather than a software problem.
Blocked airflow causes overheating, performance throttling, and excessive fan noise.

## Findings
- Cooling fan and air vents clogged with thick dust  
- Restricted airflow  
- CPU thermal paste dried out  
- Non-standard Alienware screws used

## Solution
- Opened the laptop using proper tools  
- Cleaned fan, vents, and internal components  
- Replaced dried thermal paste on the processor  
- Reassembled and tested the system  

## Outcome
- System temperature normalized  
- Fan noise eliminated  
- Performance restored  
- Customer satisfied  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Laptop hardware diagnostics  
- Cooling system maintenance  
- Thermal paste replacement  
- Performance optimization.
  
# 🧰🪛📳Home Network Setup & Guest Wi-Fi Configuration case

## Scenario
A house had an existing router supplying internet to the upstairs apartment.
The requirement was to extend internet access to the downstairs apartment and
provide a separate guest Wi-Fi network.

I was contacted to assess the setup, provide a materials and cost estimate, and
implement the solution.

## Materials & Tools Used
- Secondary Wi-Fi router
- Ethernet cables
- Crimping clips
- Networking and installation tools

## Implementation
- Connected a secondary router to the existing primary router
- Configured router settings including:
  - IP addressing
  - DHCP configuration
  - Wi-Fi SSIDs (main and guest networks)
- Applied network security best practices:
  - Strong password combinations
  - Secure Wi-Fi encryption
  - Restricted guest network access
- Crimped Ethernet cables and installed structured cabling
- Routed cables from upstairs to downstairs despite physical layout challenges

## Challenges
- Difficulty routing cables between floors
- Initial connectivity issues between routers, resolved through configuration adjustments

## Outcome
- Internet successfully extended to the downstairs apartment
- Secure guest Wi-Fi network deployed
- Stable and secure connectivity across both routers
- Client satisfied with network performance and security

## Skills Demonstrated
- Secure home and small network setup
- Router configuration (IP, DHCP, Wi-Fi)
- Network security best practices
- Cable crimping and structured cabling
- Network troubleshooting.
